Please see "CMPE297_Group2_Project_Report.pdf" for the report that explains our entire project.

Each of the data structures / methods that we explored for multidimensional data nearest neighbor querying have their respective folders (i.e. BallTreeNN, BruteForce, KDTreeNN, MTreeNN).

Inside each folder contains a main file for that exploration; running of that main file will run all the procedures for each of the data structure exploration, and generate the outputs (in the terminal) and save the figures that are seen in the images folder.
